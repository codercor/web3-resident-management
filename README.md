# Citizen Registration Blockchain Prototype

This is a blockchain prototype for citizen registration, utilizing a secure front-end login page and a back-end Solidity implementation for Ethereum chain registration. The project aims to demonstrate the potential of blockchain technology in managing citizen records securely and transparently.

## Features

- **Citizen Registration**: Citizens can register their information on the Ethereum blockchain using the provided front-end login page. The registration data is securely stored and immutable.

- **Secure Login**: The front-end login page ensures secure access to the citizen registration portal. Proper authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect user data.

- **Decentralized Storage**: The citizen registration information is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring decentralization and transparency.

- **Data Privacy**: Only the citizen and authorized parties with the right permissions can access and modify their registration data.

- **Smart Contracts**: The back-end implementation is done using Solidity smart contracts, ensuring reliable and trustless execution of the registration process.

## Technologies Used

- Solidity: Smart contract development language for Ethereum.
- React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- Ethereum: Blockchain platform for decentralized applications.
